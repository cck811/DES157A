        <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
        <p>
            Navigating through the sea of images on the internet is like being at a never-ending buffet. There's so much to see, and after a while, everything starts to blend together. Remember that time when our teacher flashed a random picture on the screen, and everyone just described what they saw? Yeah, it felt like we were all just skimming the surface. It reminded me of that "What's Going On in This Picture?" thing from The New York Times. Instead of just seeing an image, we're challenged to really look deeper and think about the story behind it.

            It's kind of like when you're scrolling through your feed, and you stop at a picture, not just because it's pretty or cool, but because it makes you feel something or think about something bigger. That's the power of images. They can speak louder than words, cross language barriers, and make us feel connected. But it's easy to just swipe past and not really 'see' what's in front of us.

            During our design classs, when we discuss these pictures, it's like everyone suddenly wakes up. We all have different stories, backgrounds, and ideas. And using images, we can share a piece of our world with others. It's not just about recognizing what's in the photo but understanding the emotions, history, or message behind it. It's a skill that, honestly, more of us should practice, especially in today's world where we're constantly bombarded with visuals.

        <h2>Reflection on Best Practices for Overlays</h2>
        <p>
            In navigating the balance between user experience and the delivery of essential content, overlays play a curious yet crucial role. This piece presents a thoughtful walkthrough on how, when, and where overlays should materialize on a user’s screen. It emphasizes user agency, suggesting overlays respond primarily to user actions, appearing not as unexpected intruders but as guided tools to enhance navigation and information gathering.

        </p>
        <p>
            Timing is another crucial aspect. Overlays that emerge in the midst of a user’s task appear disruptive; instead, they should unveil themselves at moments of pause or transition, maintaining a flow rather than interrupting it. In their positioning on the page, overlays must be mindful of visibility, ensuring that they aren’t lost beneath browser toolbars or awkwardly placed on the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ultimately, the article advocates for a user-centric approach. It encourages a reserved use of overlays, urging that they should only appear when they bring undeniable value to the user’s ongoing activity or decision-making process. Thus, design considerations should be meticulously evaluated to ensure overlays serve as beneficial companions in a user's journey, rather than cumbersome obstacles.

        <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
        <p>
            After checking out this article on form design by UX Design,I'm a bit blown away by the small stuff that makes a form click with users. They're all about making things clear, keeping users in the zone. One thing that stuck with me is the grouping of similar info. It’s like tidying up your room, when everything just feels right. Also those error messages need to apeal to the emotion of the user in a positive way, and point someone in the right direction instead.

            A notable example of a well-designed form that I've interacted with is on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon Edit your address Page</a>. The clear layout and instructions, and optimized mobile experience made the data entry process smooth. It exemplifies many of the best practices highlighted in the article, demonstrating the importance of thoughtful form design in user experience.
