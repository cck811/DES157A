        <h2>Game Design Research</h2>
        <p>
            Reading Amir Dori's insights on game design was like getting a backstage pass into the minds behind my favorite mobile games. The article was a goldmine, especially about where to stick buttons and sliders. As someone who's accidentally bought in-game perks with an errant thumb swipe, it was a bit of an 'aha' moment to learn that's by design—and not just my clumsy fingers at fault.
        </p>
        <p>
            What really got me was the section on draggable objects. I've been noodling on a puzzle game idea, and the way Dori breaks down the 'why' behind the drag-and-drop mechanics was an eye-opener. It's all about making the game feel as real as possible, even though you're just pushing pixels around. Who knew that where you stick the anchor point on a digital character could make such a big difference?
        </p>
        <p>
            Dori's article isn't just another 'how-to' list; it's more like a seasoned pro sharing the secrets of the trade over coffee. And while he's armed with a mountain of data to back up his points, he makes it all sound like common sense. It's a refreshing take that cuts through the jargon, and it's given me a bunch of lightbulb moments for my own game designs.

        <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Part One: My Hometown in Hong Kong</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/My Image.jpg" alt="Hong Kong High-Density Living">

          </figure>
          
        <p>
            There's a rhythm to the rows of windows and air conditioners that cling to the building like barnacles to a ship's hull, each unit a testament to the ingenuity and adaptability that is the lifeblood of Hong Kong. This photo, a slice of my hometown, is an ode to functionality over form, where space is a luxury and every inch is utilized. It speaks to the dense living conditions, yes, but also to a sense of community that's palpable in the shared experiences of its residents—each window another story, another family's dreams and daily lives. This image, while seemingly a pattern of repetition, is deeply personal to me. It's a canvas showcasing the vibrant, often chaotic symphony of city life, where individuality emerges not despite the uniformity, but because of it. In the context of my collection, this image stands as a bold statement on urban existence, highlighting the contrast between individual isolation and collective identity. It's not just a building; it's a microcosm of Hong Kong itself, reflective of my roots and the bustling energy that shaped me.

        <h3>Part Two: Image from Alex</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/Image from Alex.png" alt="Arches National Park Souvenir">
            <figcaption>Memory Preserved in Ink - © Alex [Chau], 2016</figcaption>
          </figure>
          
        <p>
            At first glance, Alex's image presents itself as a simple, everyday object—commonplace and unassuming. Yet, the more I gaze upon it, the more its story unfolds. The stamped date and location, "Arches National Park, July 28, 2016," serve as coordinates in time, a personal bookmark in someone's life narrative. This token, perhaps a memento from a park visit, is imbued with nostalgia and the invisible weight of memory. The most intriguing aspect is its wear, the faded ink, and the frayed edges; they whisper of the passage of time and provoke a curiosity about the journeys it has borne witness to. The obvious here is its function as a keepsake, but the mystery lies in the untold stories that prompted its creation. Was it a solitary adventure or a shared experience? A celebration or a casual expedition? These questions linger, unanswerable but evocative. As with any image, its digital presentation must be carefully managed to preserve its delicate details—the subtlety of its colors and the texture of its paper—while ensuring it doesn't overpower the layout of the webpage. This image, a simple round disc, offers a window into another's experience, inviting a contemplative exploration of the moments that mark our lives.

        <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
        <p>
            Navigating through the sea of images on the internet is like being at a never-ending buffet. There's so much to see, and after a while, everything starts to blend together. Remember that time when our teacher flashed a random picture on the screen, and everyone just described what they saw? Yeah, it felt like we were all just skimming the surface. It reminded me of that "What's Going On in This Picture?" thing from The New York Times. Instead of just seeing an image, we're challenged to really look deeper and think about the story behind it.
        </p>
        <p><a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/" target="_blank">Read the original article here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            It's kind of like when you're scrolling through your feed, and you stop at a picture, not just because it's pretty or cool, but because it makes you feel something or think about something bigger. That's the power of images. They can speak louder than words, cross language barriers, and make us feel connected. But it's easy to just swipe past and not really 'see' what's in front of us.
        </p>
        <p>
            During our design classs, when we discuss these pictures, it's like everyone suddenly wakes up. We all have different stories, backgrounds, and ideas. And using images, we can share a piece of our world with others. It's not just about recognizing what's in the photo but understanding the emotions, history, or message behind it. It's a skill that, honestly, more of us should practice, especially in today's world where we're constantly bombarded with visuals.

        <h2>Reflection on Best Practices for Overlays</h2>
        <p>
            In navigating the balance between user experience and the delivery of essential content, overlays play a curious yet crucial role. This piece presents a thoughtful walkthrough on how, when, and where overlays should materialize on a user’s screen. It emphasizes user agency, suggesting overlays respond primarily to user actions, appearing not as unexpected intruders but as guided tools to enhance navigation and information gathering.
        </p>
        <p><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/" target="_blank">Read the original article here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Timing is another crucial aspect. Overlays that emerge in the midst of a user’s task appear disruptive; instead, they should unveil themselves at moments of pause or transition, maintaining a flow rather than interrupting it. In their positioning on the page, overlays must be mindful of visibility, ensuring that they aren’t lost beneath browser toolbars or awkwardly placed on the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ultimately, the article advocates for a user-centric approach. It encourages a reserved use of overlays, urging that they should only appear when they bring undeniable value to the user’s ongoing activity or decision-making process. Thus, design considerations should be meticulously evaluated to ensure overlays serve as beneficial companions in a user's journey, rather than cumbersome obstacles.

        <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
        <p>
            After checking out this article on form design by UX Design,I'm a bit blown away by the small stuff that makes a form click with users. They're all about making things clear, keeping users in the zone. One thing that stuck with me is the grouping of similar info. It’s like tidying up your room, when everything just feels right. Also those error messages need to apeal to the emotion of the user in a positive way, and point someone in the right direction instead.
        </p>

        <p>
            A notable example of a well-designed form that I've interacted with is on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon Edit your address Page</a>. The clear layout and instructions, and optimized mobile experience made the data entry process smooth. It exemplifies many of the best practices highlighted in the article, demonstrating the importance of thoughtful form design in user experience.
