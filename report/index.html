                <h2>1. Added Introduction</h2>
                <p>An introduction can help users that are not familliar with the Madlibs game. The introduction has been addd to the page on load. </p>

                <img src="images/introBtn.gif" alt="introBtn">
                <p>A "?" button is also added for user to reopen the introduction overlay if needed.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>2. Added "Random" Button Function</h2>

                <h2>3. Added Extra Story</h2>
                <img src="images/story.png" alt="stories code">
                <p>I've added three diverse storylines that will be randomly generated. These added narratives that promise to keep the Madlibs experience varied and engaging.

                <h2>4. Visual Enhancement</h2>

                <img src="images/old.png" alt="old design composition">
                <p>In revamping the visual design of the Madlibs web project, my aim is to create a harmonious and engaging interface that enhances user focus and pleasure.</p>
                <p>I plan to modify the background by reducing the contrast of the current zig-zag pattern, thereby diminishing visual distractions and allowing the content to take center stage. The container boxes will be redesigned for uniform spacing, fostering a clean and organized layout that simplifies navigation.</p>
                <p>Interaction animations will be refined to be smoother. Buttons will illuminate upon hover to intuitively indicate interactivity. Additionally, the button section will be redesigned with increased spacing to prevent user error and to provide a more comfortable experience. The "Create Story" button will receive a size increase, making it more prominent and accessible, thereby inviting users to begin their storytelling journey with a single, unmistakable call to action.</p>
                <p>These visual enhancements are crafted to not only improve aesthetics but also to streamline the user's journey from start to finish.</p>
