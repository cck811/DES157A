    <h3>Objective: Capitalize each word in a string</h3>

    <script>
    var inputString = "every word here was typed in lowercase in visual studio code";
    var capitalizedString = ""; //used to stores the result of the string being built as the loop code processes each character
    var capitalizeNext = true; //true on defualt so the first character in inputString is capitalized

    for (var i = 0; i < inputString.length; i++) {//the loop runs & checks each character in inputString and stops at length-1
        var character = inputString[i];           //make the loop checks the character located at the i-th position, i value increases every run due to i++

        if (character === character.toLowerCase() && capitalizeNext) {//run this if the current character is in its lower case version & capitalizeNext is still true
            capitalizedString = capitalizedString + character.toUpperCase();//change the capitalizedString value to make the code to: output previous characters in capitalizedString + change the current character in upper case version
            capitalizeNext = false;               //set to false so the if statement switches to else
        } else {
            capitalizedString = capitalizedString + character;//change the capitalizedString value to make the code to: print previous characters in capitalizedString + continue to output with the current character
            if (character === ' ') { //if the current character is a Space, it determains the start of a new word
                capitalizeNext = true;
            }
        }
    }

    console.log(capitalizedString); // "Every Word Here Was Typed In Lowercase In Visual Studio Code";
